# Changelog

## 0.5.0

Completes every remaining MTProto feature from the audit — nothing deferred. All items verified against the live Telegram API (obfuscated handshake, PFS bind, future-salts, containers, CDN, web files) plus a full unit suite for the byte-level codecs.

### Transport
- **Obfuscated transport (obfuscation2)** — AES-256-CTR-wrapped stream with a randomized 64-byte init frame; enable with `useObfuscation: true`. Verified: full auth-key handshake + RPC against a live DC.
- **MTProxy** — `MtProxy.fromSecret(host, port, secret)` (hex / base64url / `dd` / `ee` secrets); pass `mtproxy:` to `MtpClient`. Embeds the target DC id in the obfuscation frame.
- **fakeTLS** — `ee`-prefixed MTProxy secrets speak fake-TLS: a GREASE-shaped ClientHello with an HMAC-SHA256 digest, then MTProto framed inside TLS `application_data` records over padded-intermediate.
- **WebSocket transport** — `webSocket: true` connects over `wss://` with obfuscation2 inside binary frames.
- **Quick-ack** — high-bit length prefixes on send and 4-byte ack-token detection on receive across abridged / intermediate.
- **Padded-intermediate** — real 0–15-byte random padding (used by MTProxy / fakeTLS).

### Perfect Forward Secrecy
- **Temp auth keys** — `usePfs: true` (with `pfsExpiresIn`) generates a temporary auth key, binds it to the permanent key via `auth.bindTempAuthKey` (`bind_auth_key_inner`, MTProto-1.0 `encryptV1` envelope), and rebinds on expiry. Verified: bind accepted + RPC over the temp key on a live DC.

### Service messages
- `msgs_state_req` → `msgs_state_info` replies; `msg_resend_req` / `msg_resend_ans_req` force-ack; `msgs_all_info`, `rpc_answer_*`, `destroy_session_*` handled.
- **`future_salts`** — `get_future_salts` returns salts (verified live); a background timer prefetches and swaps the server salt before expiry.

### Outgoing
- **Message containers** — outgoing queries batch with pending `msgs_ack` piggybacked into a single `msg_container`.
- `invokeAfterPrevious()` (`invokeAfterMsg`) chains a request after the last content message; workers wrap init in `invokeWithoutUpdates`.

### Updates
- **`qts` gap handling** for encrypted / bot updates; a gap triggers `getDifference`.
- **`updatesTooLong`** → immediate `getDifference`.

### Auth
- **Takeout sessions** — `initTakeoutSession` / `invokeWithTakeout` / `finishTakeoutSession` (`invokeWithTakeout` wrapper).
- **Test-DC support** — `testMode: true` uses the test DC address table.
- **Password recovery** — `requestPasswordRecovery` / `checkRecoveryPassword` / `recoverPassword`.

### CDN / files
- **CDN RSA config** — `loadCdnConfig()` fetches `help.getCdnConfig`, parses the PEM public keys (PKCS#1 / SPKI DER), and feeds them into the CDN-DC handshake.
- **File-hash integrity** — CDN chunks are SHA-256-verified against `upload.getCdnFileHashes`; `getFileHashes()` exposes `upload.getFileHashes`.
- **Web files** — `downloadWebFile(location)` (`upload.getWebFile`) auto-routes to `config.webfileDcId`.

## 0.4.0

Implements the remaining missing MTProto features from the deep feature audit.

### Auth
- **QR-code login** — `client.qrLogin()` (`auth.exportLoginToken` / `importLoginToken`), returns a `tg://login?token=…` URL and completes when scanned.
- **2FA password setting/changing** — `client.edit2FA(currentPassword, newPassword, hint, email)` with a new `computeDigest` SRP primitive; pass an empty `newPassword` to remove the password.
- **Multiple simultaneous DC connections with per-DC persisted auth keys** — `SessionData` now stores a `dc_keys` map (file + gogram-compatible string session). `exportToDc` reuses a cached per-DC key instead of re-running export/import each time.
- **AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED** — regenerates the auth key on that DC and retries instead of reusing a poisoned key.
- `logOut()` also clears in-memory auth and the persisted session.

### Updates
- **Common-box `pts` dedup + gap detection** — already-applied updates are skipped and a forward gap triggers `getDifference`.
- **`seq` gap detection** for `updates` / `updatesCombined` envelopes.

### Transport
- **Proxy support** — `Proxy.socks5` / `Proxy.socks4` / `Proxy.http` (with auth); pass `proxy:` to `MtpClient`.

### Files
- **CDN download** — `upload.getCdnFile` with AES-256-CTR decryption and `reuploadCdnFile` handling; CDN-served files no longer throw.

### Secret chats (E2E)
- `startSecretChat` / `acceptSecretChat` / `completeSecretChat` / `discardSecretChat` — Diffie-Hellman key exchange, key-fingerprint verification, MTProto-2.0 E2E encryption, in/out seq tracking.
- `sendSecretMessage` / `decryptSecretMessage` for text messages; `onSecretChatUpdate` / `onEncryptedMessage` handlers.

### Misc
- Default `appVersion` now tracks the library version (`libVersion`).
- TL strings and SRP passwords are UTF-8.

## 0.3.0

New MTProto features found by a deep missing-feature audit against the official docs.

### Updates
- `channels.getChannelDifference`: per-channel `pts` is now tracked and gaps are recovered via `getChannelDifference` (channels have their own message box; the common `getDifference` never returns channel messages). Handles `UpdatesChannelDifference` / `Empty` / `TooLong`.
- `updateChannelTooLong` now triggers a channel-difference catch-up instead of being dropped.
- `getDifference` now loops on `updates.differenceSlice` until it drains, instead of applying a single slice and stopping.
- Channel-message gap detection from `pts` / `pts_count` on `updateNewChannelMessage`.

### Service messages
- `msg_detailed_info` / `msg_new_detailed_info` are acknowledged (the server otherwise re-sends the notification indefinitely).
- `msgs_state_req` is answered by acking the referenced message ids.
- The periodic keepalive is now `ping_delay_disconnect` (75s), so the server also reaps a half-open connection if the client goes silent.

### Outgoing
- Requests larger than 512 bytes are `gzip_packed` before sending, per the spec's recommendation to compress large queries.

### Transport
- IPv6 endpoints are bracketed (`[addr]:port`) so the port is unambiguous; address parsing no longer breaks on the colons in IPv6.

### Auth / media
- `logOut()` now invalidates the auth key, clears the peer cache, and deletes the persisted session file.
- `inflateStrippedThumb()` reconstructs a full JPEG from a `photoStrippedSize` thumbnail.

## 0.2.9

Stability under parallel file transfer, plus a round of MTProto spec-conformance fixes.

### Stability
- Fixed an unhandled async error crash: `connect()`'s single-flight gate completed with an error that had no listener when `_doConnect` failed and no concurrent caller was waiting, killing the isolate mid-download.
- Outgoing `msgs_ack`: the client now acknowledges content-related server messages (odd seqno), batched at a threshold of 10 with a 300ms flush timer. Missing acks made the server resend and drop connections under sustained load ("Peer closed connection").
- `invoke` now retries transient network / reconnect / salt errors within a 2-minute budget instead of giving up after 3 tries, so a flapping worker recovers instead of throwing.
- Reconnect backoff is flap-aware: a connection that dies seconds after connecting no longer reconnects at full speed; the delay escalates with the flap count.
- Download now keeps `workers × pipeline` chunks in flight (pipelined) rather than just `workers`.

### MTProto spec conformance
- Decrypt now validates the message length and padding (length divisible by 4, padding in [12,1024], no read past the buffer) per the security guidelines, replacing an uncontrolled `RangeError` with a clean protocol error.
- Container inner messages now handle `bad_server_salt` / `new_session_created` / `bad_msg_notification` / `pong` / `msgs_ack`, not just `rpc_result` — previously service messages wrapped in a container were ignored.
- `gzip_packed` is now unwrapped when it appears as an update body (top-level or inside a container).
- 4-byte transport-error frames (e.g. `-404`) are detected in the transport and surfaced as `TransportError`.
- `_lastMsgId` is reset after a `bad_msg` 16/17 time correction so the monotonicity clamp doesn't pin new ids to the pre-correction clock.
- DH handshake now verifies `dh_prime` is a safe prime (Miller-Rabin on `p` and `(p-1)/2`) and that the generator `g` satisfies its quadratic-residue condition; `g_b` gets the same `2^1984` range bound as `g_a`.
- Download `chunkSize` must now divide 1 MB (in addition to being a multiple of 4096, ≤ 1 MB) so no request crosses a 1 MB boundary.

## 0.2.8

- Fixed `MSGID_DECREASE_RETRY` when a caller mixes parallel worker RPCs (via `threads: >1` on `uploadFile` / `downloadStream` / `downloadRange`) with main-connection RPCs. `copyAuthFrom` now copies the parent's `_timeOffset` so same-DC sub-clients agree with main on encoded msg-id timestamps.
- Exported sub-clients created by `exportToDc` are marked `workerMode = true` and skip the updates loop / ping timer, avoiding needless `updates.getState` traffic on file-transfer workers.
- Raised the internal `_maxWorkers` cap from 3 to 16 so explicit `threads: N` requests up to 16 are honored.
- Verified end-to-end at `threads` = 1, 4, 8, 12: no `MSGID_DECREASE_RETRY`, byte-exact roundtrip, main connection intact for subsequent RPCs.

## 0.2.7

- Logger now prefixes each line with a `HH:MM:SS.mmm` timestamp by default. Disable via `Logger(showTimestamp: false)`.

## 0.2.6

- Updated Telegram API to layer 228 (from TDesktop dev).
- README rewritten for clarity, with an expanded Flutter integration example.

## 0.2.5

- New `client.downloadBlock(peer:, msgId:, blockIndex:)` — a streaming-optimized
  single-block fetch for local range servers. Downloads one aligned block
  (default 1 MB) clamped to the file's real size, over the primary connection
  with the 512 KB pipelined sub-chunk config that benchmarked fastest and most
  drop-resistant for serialized byte-range streaming (a local HTTP shim feeding
  a player: 512 KB sub-chunks pipeline two `Upload.getFile` per block ≈ 1.4 MB/s
  vs ≈ 0.9 MB/s for a single 1 MB request). Wraps `downloadMessageRange` with
  the offset/clamp math a range server would otherwise repeat, sharing the same
  media cache and `file_reference` refresher. Returns an empty list past EOF.

## 0.2.4

- `downloadRange` worker pool now puts the primary (main) connection first and
  always includes it. The primary connection is the most stable; exported
  sub-DC senders can be dropped by the DC under concurrent load, so preferring
  the primary eliminates the "Peer closed connection" reconnect churn that was
  tanking sustained throughput. Retuned `_countWorkers` / `_pipelinePerWorker`
  for pipelined reads on the primary connection.

## 0.2.3

- Tuned `downloadRange` concurrency: 4 connections x 4 pipelined requests each,
  retuned `_countWorkers` thresholds. Balances throughput against the DC's
  connection-drop anti-abuse on high-latency mobile paths.

## 0.2.2

Fixes video playback stability + eliminates player jank. Validated end-to-end
with ffprobe/ffmpeg against a real streamed file (clean decode mid-file, no
corruption, faster than realtime).

- **Off-isolate decryption.** Large ciphertexts (file chunks, ≥128 KB) now
  decrypt in a persistent worker-isolate pool (`decrypt_pool.dart`) instead of
  on the main isolate. The AES-IGE block loop no longer blocks UI rendering /
  the local stream server — measured main-isolate stalls dropped from ~90 ms to
  ~38 ms during sustained streaming. `_processIncoming` / `deserializeEncrypted`
  gained async variants; small messages still decrypt inline. Dispatch is by
  msgId so the isolate hop cannot reorder RPC results.
- **Reconnect no longer crashes downloads.** Transient "pending request
  invalidated" reconnect errors are retried instead of surfacing as an
  unhandled async exception (which previously killed the serving connection —
  the "nothing plays" symptom for HTTP-streamed media).

## 0.2.1

Streaming throughput + smoothness fixes (benchmarked on a high-RTT mobile path).

### downloadRange / worker pool
- Per-connection request **pipelining** (up to 3 concurrent `upload.getFile`
  per connection, demuxed by msgId) — the previous 1-request-per-worker model
  capped throughput at ~1 MB/s on high-RTT paths. Measured ~10x improvement
  (0.3 → 3+ MB/s sustained). Connection count kept low because DCs drop many
  simultaneous fresh connections; pipelining supplies the concurrency instead.
- Transient reconnect errors ("reconnect: pending request invalidated",
  "Not connected", timeouts) are now **retryable** in the part-fetch loop
  instead of fatally aborting the whole range download.
- `Future.wait(eagerError: false)` on part fetches so a fast-failing part can't
  orphan sibling in-flight parts (which previously surfaced as an unhandled
  async exception during a reconnect storm).
- `_countWorkers` retuned; retries per part raised to 20 with capped backoff.

### crypto
- AES-IGE encrypt/decrypt rewritten to be **allocation-free per block** (was
  ~3 `Uint8List` allocations per 16-byte block → ~96k allocations + heavy GC
  per 512 KB chunk on the single Dart isolate, a major source of video-player
  jank / frozen spinners). Verified byte-identical to the previous output.

## 0.2.0

Streaming engine release. Three deep-audit rounds against a gogram reference (150+ raw findings, ~80 confirmed, ~50 fixed).

### Layer + codegen
- Bumped Telegram API to **layer 227** (from TDesktop dev).
- Fixed `tool/tlgen.dart` handling of `{X:Type}` generics and `!X` template refs.

### File streaming
- New `client.downloadStream(location)` returns `Stream<Uint8List>` (in-order, parallel workers under the hood).
- New `client.downloadRange(location, start, end)` for arbitrary byte ranges with parallel workers, FILE_MIGRATE + FILE_REFERENCE_EXPIRED handling.
- New `client.streamMessage(peer, msgId)` and `client.downloadMessageRange(peer, msgId, start, end)` — resolve media via the built-in cache and yield bytes.
- New `TelegramFileStreamServer` — local HTTP server that publishes any Telegram file as a URL with full **HTTP Range 206** support, HEAD, CORS, seek-aware prefetch, per-entry LRU chunk cache, and per-request cancellation on client disconnect. Feed the URL to `mediakit` / `video_player` / `<video>`.
- `server.publishMessage(peer, msgId)` returns a stable URL; the chunk cache lives across HTTP requests.
- `server.warmup(dcId, workers)` pre-opens cross-DC senders so first fetch doesn't pay exportAuth latency.
- `MediaLocationCache` — LRU keyed by `(peerId, msgId)` → `ResolvedMedia(location, size, mime, dcId, fileName, duration)` with 20h TTL under Telegram's 24h `file_reference` window.

### Session + peer persistence
- Peer cache (users, channels, chats, usernames) now serialized inside `SessionData` and reloaded on next start — no more re-resolve after app restart.
- Atomic session write (unique tmp filename + POSIX rename, no delete-then-rename data-loss window).
- Async debounced flush (2s window) + guaranteed flush on `close()`.
- String session format now byte-compatible with gogram (`1BvE` + RawURL base64 JSON; legacy `1BvX` also parsed correctly for binary keys via latin1).
- `SessionData.dcId` always round-trips.

### Reconnect + transport
- `_ensureReady` waits for in-flight reconnect (bounded by client `timeout`); no more racing double-dials.
- `_reconnect` is single-flight, uses persisted auth key, exponential backoff with jitter.
- Ping is fire-and-forget — no leaked pending completers.
- `bad_msg` codes 32/33/48 drain all pending requests and let `invoke()` transparently retry on the fresh session.
- `bad_server_salt` transparently retries only the affected request (was killing all pending).
- Terminal auth errors (AUTH_KEY_UNREGISTERED, etc.) disable autoReconnect; a subsequent successful `loginBot` / `signIn` / `checkPassword` re-enables it.
- Transport now tracks `lastReadAt`; `_ensureReady` force-reconnects if the socket has been idle >90s (catches silently-dead sockets after Android backgrounding).
- Transport `close()` wakes stuck reads instead of hanging.
- Read-idle timeout on transport (75s) surfaces silently-dead peers.

### File upload/download
- Upload closes RAF only after all worker futures resolve (was closing while siblings still reading).
- `chunkSize` validated as power-of-2 multiple of 1024 that divides 512 KB.
- FLOOD_WAIT respected per part.
- Retries bounded, non-retryable errors (StateError, UnimplementedError) fail fast instead of looping 5 times.
- Parallel `downloadStream` stops correctly on last chunk (not on any short chunk).

### Crypto + TL correctness
- TL strings are now UTF-8 (was UTF-16 code units — broke every non-ASCII payload).
- `bigIntToBytes` fixed: big-endian left-pad, high-order trim (was truncating low bytes / padding wrong side).
- `auth_key` left-padded to exactly 256 bytes.
- `writeBytes` refuses payloads > 16 MiB instead of silently truncating.

### Android/Flutter
- No default relative `sessionFile` — you must pass an absolute path (from `path_provider`).
- Login callback prompts throw a clear error on mobile instead of using stdin.
- SIGINT handler uses logger instead of print.
- Everything runs on `dart:io` only — no `dart:mirrors`/`dart:ffi`/isolates. See `example/flutter_engine.dart` for a ready-to-drop `TgEngine` singleton.

### Cache correctness
- Access hash preserved when server sends minimal peer without hash.
- Reverse username mappings pruned on rename.
- LRU eviction (default 100k users / 20k channels) prevents unbounded growth in long-running engines.
- `getDifference` backs off on FLOOD_WAIT instead of hammering every 3s.

## 0.1.3

- Fixed DC migration loop: migrate now kills the old poll loop before reconnecting, preventing duplicate pollers and repeated migrations.
- Migration depth capped at 5 (matching gogram) to prevent infinite recursion.
- Poll loop and reconnect logic bail immediately during active migration instead of racing.

## 0.1.2

- Fixed reconnect-spam loop: long-poll TCP reads no longer time out at 15s and trigger false reconnects.
- Reconnect is now single-flight (mutex-guarded), capped at 20 attempts, with exponential backoff (1s → 30s max).
- Poll loop runs once per client lifetime — no more concurrent pollers spawned per reconnect.

## 0.1.1

- Shorter pub.dev description.
- Replaced stub example with a real bot quickstart (inline buttons + callback handler).
- Bumped `pointycastle` to `^4.0.0` and `lints` to `^6.0.0`.
- Added dartdoc coverage on generated TL types and the main client surface.
